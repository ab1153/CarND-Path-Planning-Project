## Reflection

The local path is basically generated by a cubic spline where a set of 5 points fit. These points are chosen based on the predefined way points and converted in frenet coordinate. They are computed from the current car position and onward in the longitude ***s*** direction. The behavior of lane changing is determined by a series of if-statements using the instant sensor fusions data from the simulator which result in the change of the lateral displacement ***d***. The car is able to drive without violating speed, acceleration and jerk limits by just following the polynomial trajectory.
